# Z-shell dotfiles

These are my z-shell dotfiles. They're pretty great.

## Installation

Download and copy everything in `home` to your home directory, or use
[homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) and save
yourself the trouble:

    $ homesick clone jgorset/zsh-dotfiles
    $ homesick symlink jgorset/zsh-dotfiles

## Thanks

My dotfiles are derivatives of the incredible
[oh my zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).
